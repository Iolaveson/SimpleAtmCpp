# Overview

I wanted to get my feet wet and learn the syntax and wanted to see how other languages handled libraries so I made a simple atm program that uses two libraries and took a lot of special syntax to make a simple console app. The code at the time of writing allows a single user to access two fake bank accounts and withdraw or deposit any amount they wish, I do have plans to explore c++ more and add functionality which you will find below.

# Development Environment

replit

C++

This was the enviroment I used since replit allows you to run c++ code without having a separate complier but any c++ enviroment will work. 

# Useful Websites

These two websites were super helpful for this project

- [replit](replit.com)
- [W3schools for c++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add a way to only allow withdrawls if money is in bank account
- Add functionality to move money between accounts
- Add multiple users
